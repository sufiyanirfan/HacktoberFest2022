# Flappy Bird Game in JavaScript

An endless game called Flappy Bird has a bird that the user can manage. The player must prevent the bird from hitting obstacles like pipes. The score increases by one each time the bird goes through a pipe. When the bird hits the pipes or plummets to the ground owing to gravity, the game is over.
